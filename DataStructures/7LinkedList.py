#LinkedList

'''
1.It is a collection or group of nodes
2.each node contains data and reference(point) which contains the address of next node
3.It is a linear data structure
4.Elements are stored randomly in memeory

'''

#Why Linkedlist
'''
1.Linked list is having more efficiency for performing the operations as compared to list
2.Elements are stored randomly wheras in list at contiguous memeory
3.Accessing the elements in linked list will be slower as compare to list
4.Utilization of memory is higher than the list

'''

#Singly Linked List
#It is traversed only in one direction

#Circular Linked List ((((1.Singly circular linked list 2.Doubly linked list ))))
#Last node contains the address of first node


#Advantages
'''

1. Dynamic in size
2. No wastage as capacity and size is always equal
3. Easy insertion and deletion as 1 link manipulation is required
4. Efficient memory allocation

'''

#Dis-Advantages
'''
1. if head node is lost ,linked list is lost
2. no random access is possible
