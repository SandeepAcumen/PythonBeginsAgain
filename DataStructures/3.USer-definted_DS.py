#User-defined Data structure

#1.Stack
'''
1. Workd on the basis og Last-in-First-out principle
2. Element can be pushed,accessed and popped as required.
3. Elements are accessed only from the top position.

'''

#2.Queue
'''
1. Works on the basis of First-in-first-out principle
2. Queues have both head and tail sections
3. Operations can be performed from both the head and the tail.

'''

#3.Tree
'''
1.The data originates from the root node of the tree
2.Every node that precedes another node is called as the parent node
3.Last node in the tree are called as leaves.

'''
#4.Graph
'''
A graph is a collection of nodes and edges
1.Nodes are also called as vertices and edges are called as arcs.
2.A valid graph structure consists of finite set of nodes and edges.

'''
#5.Linked List (Singly Linked list,Double Linked list,Circular Linked list)
'''
It consists of sequence of elements that are connected to each other
1.Each data element is connected to another one via pointers.
2.Python does not have linked lists in its standard library.
3.Implementation has to be done using lists manually.
