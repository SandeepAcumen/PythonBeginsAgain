1.What is data modeling?
   Data modeling is the process of creating a blueprint of how data 
is stored,coonect and retrived in a system
As a Data Engineer,its not just about pipwlines and tools -you need to
design data strcture that supports reporting, scalability and performance.


2.Why it Matters??
   Makes data easier to understand and use Improves query performance,
Helps build scalable systems


3.Types of Data Models?
  a.Conceptual  (hight level overview)
  -- Hight level view
  -- Entites and thier relatioships

  b.Logical
  -- Includes attributes,relationships
  -- No concern for data types or DBMS

  c.Physical
  -- Real implementayion
  -- Data types, constraints, index, partition

4.OLTP vs OLAP Models?

OLTP --Oline transactional processing
     --Transactions easily
     --used for writiing the data in DBMS
     --Normalization


OLAP --Oline Analytical processing
     --Dimensional Data Models
     --Used to read for Analytical process


5.What is ETL pipwlines?

6.What is ETL Layers??

    Source -> Stage -> Trasform -> Serve(here we build the model)

7.Where Data Modeling Fits??
   Data modeling fits in Curated Layer from below
   Raw --> Enriched --> Curated

8.Medallion Architecture?
